# Userscripts

These are userscripts I made for use for myself, that I thought could be here.
Also, if it opens 2 tabs, idk why it does that so don't blame it on me.

## [Max Max](https://github.com/ccn0/userscripts/raw/main/scripts/maxmax.user.js)

Removes the gradients, TV ratings, and auto skips intro.
I'll add features as I need them.

## [No Round Corners](https://github.com/ccn0/userscripts/raw/main/scripts/noroundcorners.user.js)

No round corners, ever.

## [YouTube Helper](https://github.com/ccn0/userscripts/raw/main/scripts/youtubehelper.user.js)

Removes the Thanks, Voice search, and Join buttons.
If you open settings it turns off the video previews.
It tries to hide the shorts panel.
The share link doesn't have the long token.
All links don't have the redirect token.
